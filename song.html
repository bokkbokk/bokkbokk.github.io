    <h1>Red Moon - Big Thief</h1>
    <pre class="lyrics"> Red moon rising like a fire in me
So many questions, she asks them all to me
I have to answer most curiously
Scarlet angel, I am too small to see
Earn, earn, shuffle 'round the big city
Burning the rubber down, crossing the hot concrete
I'm gonna leave town, there is someone to meet
She turns her head around a full three-sixty
Woo

Bedroom rising from an old growth tree
Bringing out the sawmill, cutting the twelve-inch beams
Building a pattern, the reservoir to fill with dreams
Rings like Saturn telling their old story
Windmills turn and turn eternally
What do you yearn for? Where do you long to be?
I've been here before, looking at the wild country
Open the screen door, talking with Diane Lee
That's my grandma

Radio singing from the corner of the kitchen
I got the oven on, I got the onions wishing
They hadn't made me cry, filling the sink with dishes
Letting them air dry, waiting for the wind's permission
Too many movies got me shivering and shy
Turning the lights out, glistening in the owl's eye
Glimmer like lightning under the violet sky
Shimmer like diamonds, watching the red moon rise
Ooh</pre>
